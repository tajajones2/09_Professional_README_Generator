# Professional README Generator


## Description

This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

Once the repository is cloned or downloaded the user will then need to:

- Install the npm package(s): Open a terminal to the location inside the downloaded folder. Run 'npm i' to install the packages.


## Usage

- Using a command-line application that accepts user input
when you are prompted for information about my application repository
then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of your project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

- When you enter my project title then this is displayed as the title of the README.

- When you enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.

- When you choose a license for my application from a list of options then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.

- When you enter my GitHub username then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile.

- When you enter my email address then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions

- When you click on the links in the Table of Contents then you are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
